# My_plotter_app

This is a simple app I created in other to replace the manual plotting of graphs during experimental physics classes at my Institution.
Purely written in python and deployed with [streamlit](share.streamlit.io).

Manually plotting graphs by hands on a graph paper doesn't give an accurate best fit line, so i decided to automate this process with this app.
It contains two sections: **plot from table of values** or **plot from function** , the first requires you supply a table of value i.e X and Y values, in other to generate a best fit line). While the latter requires you input a function for a **2D** or **3D** plot.  

*N.B: as there's no way to easily account for all domain of arbitrary functions without complicating the whole code , users would have to supply the plot ranges manually while keeping the domain of the function in mind.*

If you have any suggestions to help improve the app (functionality/layout/usability,etc) ,please feel free to reach out.
